					<h2>A Legacy of Greatness</h2>
					<p>Over the past many years, FOSO has grown to be a place that many of us know and love. Our cherished traditions have grown, developed, and renewed over time. We've seen great men come on the floor, and we've seen great men leave the floor. What makes this place special is it's community: a brotherhood of dudes who come together to do life, enjoy some Smash Bros, and eat rhubarb. All important things. These values and traditions shape who we are becoming as a floor, and it's this legacy that spurs us towards a bright future. Here on FOSO, we truly do stand on the shoulders of giants.</p>

					<h2>A Place to be Proud Of</h2>
					<p>FOSO is a place that encourages floor pride. While we have some great traditions, relics, and - of course - the beloved Captain, the men on this floor really make this place a floor to be proud of. The community, hysterics, and unique personalities shape this floor in big and small ways. As FOSO grows, these uniquenesses should be brought to light and celebrated; each member should have a part in shaping who we are becoming. We can be proud of traditions and relics, but let us not forget most of all to be proud of the men who dwell here -- proud of ourselves.</p>

					<h2>A Bright Future Unfolds</h2>
					<p>This next year is going to be a busy one. Seniors will prepare for the world outside of the Taylor Bubble. Freshmen will enter the floor and quickly be assimilated into the floor culture. Homework will be procrastinated, video games will be played, and sleep will be all but forgotten. Such is the way of FOSO. As the year progresses, let us not forget to love God, each other, and the floor. We can only grow as a community when we are ready as individuals. I see a bright future for FOSO; already, it is becoming reality. This is a place people desire to be. A hub of activity in Gerig. Let's continue to grow in that vision and seek to be the model for the rest of campus.</p>
